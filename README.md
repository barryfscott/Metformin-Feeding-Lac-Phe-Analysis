# Metformin-Feeding-Lac-Phe-Analysis

Welcome to the repository for our research showing that  Metformin and meals increases the levels of the appetite-suppressing metabolite N-Lactoyl Phenylalanine (Lac-Phe). Our findings are published in Nature Metabolism as:  

**Metformin and feeding increase levels of the appetite suppressing metabolite Lac-Phe**
